#+TITLE: Instrucitons

* Challenge
Given a text file ~numbers.txt~ that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

* Example
Given the following contents of ~numbers.txt~:
#+begin_src
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
#+end_src

Your script should output the following:
#+begin_src
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
#+end_src

* Bonus challenges
- Make the script accept the file name as an argument
- Output invalid phone numbers beneath the valid ones
  - Separate the groups with a newline
- add a flag to the script which allows the user to request
  the script to output valid or invalid numbers.
