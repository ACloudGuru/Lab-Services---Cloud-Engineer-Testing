* Programming Challenges
Approx. time to complete per challenge: 5-20 minutes

** Instructions
This collection of challenges offer a range of tests for scripting & general programming
familiarity. Choose from the available challenges to complete; clarity of code, and
methodology is valued more than working code in these cases. Use pseudocode if you are unfamiliar with the syntax, libraries, etc.

Choose any of the challenges found in this directory. Place the outputs of
any completed challenges within the ~outputs/Programming/Challenge-X/~ directory.

** How are these graded?
Challenges are not graded primarily on whether the code executes without error.
Prioritize clarity of any code you do write, and be sure to communicate intention
in the solutions.

Pseudocode indicative of the correct solution is fine if you are
not familiar with the required syntax/libraries to write a working solution.
