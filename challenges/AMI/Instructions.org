*** Create Initial EC2 Instance
Create an EC2 instance of type t3.medium from ~ami-0ef786ed948920e48~.

Once the image is ready, connect and run the ~install.sh~ script found in
this repository at ~resources/AMI/install.sh~.

After the script is run, ensure the following software is installed on the
instance:

#+begin_src
#+end_src

Ensure the following services are enabled at startup:
#+begin_src
#+end_src


*** Create & Verify Image
When the configuration is complete, proceed to make an AMI from the EC2 instance.

The new AMI should delete its volumes upon termination.

Once the AMI is ready, create a new EC2 instance from it.

Verify the instance has the desired configuration, and run the validation script
found in this repository at ~resources/AMI/validate.sh~


Download the contents of ~outputs~ on the remote server, and save them to this
repository at ~outputs/AMI/~.
